## 🎯 Development Guidelines

- **Always run tests** before deployment
- **Use the staging environment** for testing changes
- **Follow the deployment runbook** for production changes
- **Database changes require migrations** via Prisma
- **Security-first approach** - validate all inputs, sanitize outputs
- **Performance monitoring** - check metrics after deployments
- **Documentation updates** - keep deployment docs current

## 📞 Operational Procedures

- **Staging Deploy**: Automatic on release creation
- **Production Deploy**: Manual via GitHub Actions with approval
- **Rollback**: `./deploy/scripts/deploy.sh prod rollback`
- **Database Recovery**: `./deploy/scripts/restore-db.sh prod <backup-file>`
- **Health Monitoring**: `https://your-domain.com/api/health`
