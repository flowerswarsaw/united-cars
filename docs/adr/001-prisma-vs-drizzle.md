# ADR-001: Prisma vs Drizzle for Database ORM

## Status
**Accepted**

## Context
We need to choose a database ORM for United Cars that provides type safety, good developer experience, and supports our PostgreSQL requirements. The two main contenders are Prisma and Drizzle.

## Decision
We will use **Prisma** as our database ORM.

## Rationale

### Prisma Advantages
1. **Mature Ecosystem** - Battle-tested in production, extensive community
2. **Excellent Developer Experience** - VS Code integration, autocompletion, error detection
3. **Type Safety** - Generated client with full TypeScript support
4. **Migration Management** - Robust migration system with version control
5. **Prisma Studio** - Built-in database GUI for development
6. **Documentation** - Comprehensive docs and learning resources
7. **Next.js Integration** - Official Next.js support and examples

### Drizzle Considerations
1. **Performance** - Potentially faster query execution
2. **SQL-like API** - More familiar to SQL developers
3. **Smaller Bundle** - Lighter runtime footprint
4. **Flexibility** - More control over query generation

### Why Prisma Wins for Our Use Case

#### 1. **Team Velocity**
Our team needs to move fast in the MVP phase. Prisma's superior DX, autocompletion, and error prevention will accelerate development.

#### 2. **Type Safety Requirements**
United Cars has complex domain relationships (orgs, users, vehicles, invoices). Prisma's generated client catches relationship errors at compile time.

#### 3. **Migration Management**
We anticipate frequent schema changes in early development. Prisma's migration system is more mature and less error-prone.

#### 4. **Debugging & Visibility**
Prisma Studio provides immediate database inspection without external tools.

#### 5. **Ecosystem Integration**
Better integration with our chosen stack (Next.js, TypeScript, deployment platforms).

## Implementation Details

### Schema Example
```prisma
model Vehicle {
  id             String        @id @default(cuid())
  orgId          String        @map("org_id")
  vin            String
  status         VehicleStatus @default(SOURCING)
  
  org            Org           @relation(fields: [orgId], references: [id])
  invoiceLines   InvoiceLine[]
  
  @@unique([orgId, vin])
  @@map("vehicles")
}
```

### Generated Client Usage
```typescript
// Type-safe queries with autocompletion
const vehicle = await prisma.vehicle.findUnique({
  where: { id: vehicleId },
  include: {
    org: true,
    invoiceLines: {
      include: { invoice: true }
    }
  }
})
```

## Alternatives Considered

### Drizzle
- **Pros**: Performance, SQL-like syntax, smaller bundle
- **Cons**: Less mature ecosystem, steeper learning curve, fewer examples

### Raw SQL with typed query builders
- **Pros**: Maximum performance and control
- **Cons**: No type safety, manual migration management, slower development

### TypeORM
- **Pros**: Decorator-based, familiar to Java/C# developers
- **Cons**: Heavy runtime, complex configuration, performance issues

## Consequences

### Positive
- Faster development velocity
- Fewer runtime database errors
- Better debugging experience
- Easier onboarding for new developers
- Robust migration system

### Negative
- Slightly larger bundle size
- Less control over generated SQL
- Vendor lock-in to Prisma ecosystem
- Learning curve for developers new to Prisma

### Migration Path
If performance becomes critical or we need more SQL control, we can:
1. Optimize critical queries with raw SQL
2. Gradually migrate to Drizzle for specific modules
3. Use Prisma for development, optimize in production

## Success Metrics
- Development velocity (features per sprint)
- Database-related bugs (should decrease)
- Developer satisfaction (surveys)
- Query performance (monitoring)

## Review Date
This decision will be reviewed in 6 months (Q2 2024) based on:
- Performance metrics
- Developer experience feedback
- Ecosystem evolution
- Scaling requirements
