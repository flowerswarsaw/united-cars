# United Cars Setup Verification

## âœ… Acceptance Criteria Verification

### 1. Docker Compose Setup
```bash
# Start services
make up

# Check services are running
docker compose ps
# Expected: postgres (healthy), redis (healthy), web (running)
```

### 2. Database Setup
```bash
# Run migrations and seed
make db

# Verify tables created
docker compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d united_cars -c "\dt"
# Expected: 20+ tables including orgs, users, vehicles, invoices
```

### 3. Application Access
```bash
# Open application
open http://localhost:3000

# Expected: United Cars homepage with login/dashboard links
```

### 4. Authentication Test
1. Navigate to `/login`
2. Login with `admin@demo.com` / `admin123`
3. Should redirect to `/dashboard`
4. Verify dashboard shows stats and navigation

### 5. Core Functionality Tests

#### Vehicle Management
1. Navigate to `/vehicles`
2. Should see 2 demo vehicles (Honda Accord, Toyota Corolla)
3. Vehicle table shows VIN, status, purchase price
4. Action buttons (View, Calculate, Invoice) present

#### Calculator Functions
```bash
# Test auction calculator API
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/calc/auction \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "auction": "COPART",
    "carPriceUSD": 15000,
    "accountType": "C",
    "titleType": "clean",
    "payment": "secured"
  }'

# Expected: JSON response with breakdown, totalFeesUSD, outTheDoorUSD
```

#### Invoice Creation
1. Should see demo invoice INV-2024-001 for $1,650
2. Invoice shows line items for towing and shipping
3. PDF download should work (stub implementation)

#### Payment Workflow
1. Demo payment intent should be "SUBMITTED"
2. Admin can confirm/reject payments
3. Status updates reflect in system

#### Admin Pricing
1. Navigate to `/admin/pricing/*`
2. Should be able to view/edit fee matrices
3. Changes saved to database

### 6. API Endpoints Test
All endpoints should respond without 500 errors:
- `GET /api/me` (session info)
- `GET /api/vehicles` (vehicle list)
- `POST /api/calc/auction` (auction calculator)
- `GET /api/invoices` (invoice list)
- `GET /api/admin/pricing/auction-fees` (pricing data)

### 7. Database Integrity
```sql
-- Verify seed data
SELECT count(*) FROM orgs; -- Expected: 2
SELECT count(*) FROM users; -- Expected: 2  
SELECT count(*) FROM vehicles; -- Expected: 2
SELECT count(*) FROM invoices; -- Expected: 1
SELECT count(*) FROM auction_fee_matrices; -- Expected: 2+
```

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Port Conflicts
```bash
# Check if ports are in use
lsof -i :3000  # Next.js
lsof -i :5432  # PostgreSQL
lsof -i :6379  # Redis

# Stop conflicting services
make down
```

#### Database Connection
```bash
# Test database connectivity
docker compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d united_cars -c "SELECT 1;"

# Check database logs
docker compose logs postgres
```

#### Build Errors
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
make clean
make up

# Check build logs
docker compose logs web
```

#### Missing Dependencies
```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Check package versions
pnpm list
```

## ðŸ“Š Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Performance
- **Page Load**: < 2s for dashboard
- **API Response**: < 500ms for calculations
- **Database Queries**: < 100ms for simple operations
- **Memory Usage**: < 512MB for development

### Load Testing
```bash
# Install testing tools
npm install -g autocannon

# Test API endpoint
autocannon -c 10 -d 30 http://localhost:3000/api/calc/auction

# Expected: > 100 req/sec
```

## ðŸ§ª Test Suite Execution

### Unit Tests
```bash
# Run calculator tests
cd packages/calc
pnpm test

# Expected: All tests pass
```

### API Tests
```bash
# Run API integration tests
cd apps/web
pnpm test:api

# Expected: Authentication, CRUD, and calculation tests pass
```

### E2E Tests
```bash
# Run Playwright tests
pnpm test:e2e

# Expected: Login â†’ Dashboard â†’ Vehicles â†’ Calculate flow works
```
